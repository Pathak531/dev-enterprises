# Getting Started with Create React App

A professional project README for applications bootstrapped with **Create React App (CRA)**.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This project is initialized using **Create React App**, a widely used toolchain that provides a modern, zero-configuration setup for building React applications. It includes an optimized build process, development server, testing environment, and extensible configuration.

---

## 📦 Available Scripts

Inside the project directory, the following commands are available:

### **1. `npm start`**

Starts the application in **development mode**.

* Opens the app automatically at **[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)**.
* Hot reloads the UI on code changes.
* Displays lint warnings and errors in the console.

### **2. `npm test`**

Runs the test suite in **interactive watch mode**.

* Automatically re-runs tests on file updates.
* Supports Jest-based unit testing provided by CRA.

### **3. `npm run build`**

Creates an optimized **production-ready** build.

* Outputs files to the `build/` folder.
* Minifies JavaScript and generates hashed filenames.
* Ensures best performance for deployment.

### **4. `npm run eject`** 🔥

**Warning:** Ejecting is irreversible.

* Exposes configuration files such as Webpack, Babel, ESLint, and more.
* Recommended only when full control over the build system is required.
* All CRA-managed scripts become local configuration files.

## 📁 Production Deployment

After running `npm run build`, serve the contents of the `build/` folder using any modern hosting provider:

* Netlify
* Vercel
* GitHub Pages
* AWS S3 / CloudFront
* Render / Railway

Ensure your server is configured to fallback requests to `index.html` for client-side routing.
